# [Avito Backend Trainee Project](https://github.com/avito-tech/backend-trainee-assignment-2024?tab=readme-ov-file)
You can find postman API docs [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30507430/2sA3BgAFUB).

## Some thoughts...
> Found out that it's possible to use codegenerators to parse `openapi.yml` file and generated handlers. But generated code was too strange and I decided to do it by myself....

> Decided to use two tables: banners and features; this allows us to have multiple features for single banner. Scheme is shown in a picture.  

<img src="./assets/db_scheme.png" width=50%>

> How to get 403 status for /user_banner...? Under these conditions probably when token is incorrect.

> Decided to use go-json module [[Benchmarks]](https://github.com/goccy/go-json?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks)

> No details provided about auth token generation. Let's agree that users & admins can obtain their API tokens in their account settings OR it's generated by superior service.

> Didn't make cache struct over db struct because only one method is cached.
